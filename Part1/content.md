## Description
The aim of the project is to send data to a smartphone via BLE.  
The data mentioned above was received from ÔΩÅ PCB that is used to measure electrochemical analysis signal strength.  
What I had done was to replace the former Arduino NANO (for reading data) with nrf52840 in order to implement BLE function.  
Moreover,simply modify the ble-related app code on the Internet to meet the required need.   

## Techniques in use 
* BLE
* GPIO
* Nordic UART Service
